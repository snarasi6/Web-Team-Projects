# Web-Team-Projects
The Web Team of MIT (http://www.mitindia.edu/en/web-team-of-mit) is a Student organization which created and manages the websites of Anna University, MIT campus. I joined the team in the year May,2016 and later in april,2017 was elected as the Chairman of the club. While I was a part of the organization, my team and I worked on many projects.
The links for all the websites created are given below.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY  - http://it.mitindia.edu/

COMPUTER SCIENCE        -http://ct.mitindia.edu/

ECE                     - http://ece.mitindia.edu/

PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY   -http://pt.mitindia.edu/

AUTOMOBILE ENGINEERING  -http://auto.mitindia.edu/

Some of the interesting things to note is that the ECE website http://ece.mitindia.edu/ has a simple interface and this website was created from scratch by myself in just 7 hours without using any Bootstrap framework.
The websites have optimized page load time by enabling caching, compression of Image files and optimized CSS delivery by using External CSS.

An admin panel was designed for the websites for periodically updating contents of the website. This is done such that you don't have to navigate through the HTML codes to change the content of the website. Instead a front end panel was provided and all the changes can be done using that.
